# projectOfTheSide
A client for managing a mailing list

My first side project. It's nothing too special. It allows the user to input an email address and add it/remove it from a mailing list. Then the user can enter an email 
subject/body. Then they can input their smtp address and username/password and hit send to send the email to everyone in the mailing list. The bottom 3 fields [password,
username, smtp] aren't saved because I don't know how to encrypt them. 

I haven't been super active recently. However, I just learned about environmental variables
so should have some more projects up soon.
